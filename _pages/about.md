Hey, welcome to my Page! I'm Joris, Computer Science Student based in Berlin. I am interested in Programming, Math and everything that's related to that. In this page you can find Blogposts, Project introductions and a more detailed CV.

I'am interested in Cloud Engineering and Cloud Technologies. I could already gain professional Experience int the Microsoft Azure Cloud. I have joined the Google Developer Student Club to deepen my Knowledge using the Google Cloud Platform. Right now I am working towards my first academic publication and first big Open Source Contribution regarding the ProM-Platform. Stay tuned and happy Browsing.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
